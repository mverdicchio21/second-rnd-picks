        <h1>How well do NBA Teams Draft in the Second Round?</h1>
        <p class="byline">By Mason Verdicchio</p>
        <p class="dek">Two years ago, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3112335/nikola-jokic">Nikola Jokic</a> became the second player ever drafted in the second round to win MVP, and last year became the first to ever win the award back to back. This begs the question, how often do 2nd rounders pan out for NBA teams? </p>

        <p>In other professional sports leagues in America, second round picks are seen as extremely valuable, and give a team the potential to draft a future star.  Take the NFL for example, where second round picks often end up being starters or potentially pro bowlers. When a second round pick is traded in the NFL, it is usually a big trade that includes a star player or an even higher first round pick. This is not the case in the NBA. While second round picks hold some value, in comparison to other leagues they hold very little. With each roster allowed 15 players, there are only so many prospects that make it to the league, thus negating the need for a draft more than two rounds and lowering the chances that a second round pick in the NBA becomes, at the very least, a solid rotational player. </p>
        <p>In 2004, the NBA expanded to 30 teams across North America with the addition of the Charlotte Bobcats (now called the Hornets). Since then, there have been 30 players selected in the second round every year since. Every team gets one second round pick and has the ability to trade the pick away, whether that be in a salary dump trade, a huge trade package for a star player, or anything in between. This means that 540 players have been drafted in the second round over the last 18 years (We are not including players from the 2022 draft). This brings up a good question. How many players drafted in the second round have become solid rotational players, or even all-stars? </p> <p>To start, we have to establish what criteria is considered when calling someone a good rotational player. To help with this process, I interviewed Matt Bloom, a current high school basketball coach in New Jersey. Before coaching, Bloom worked in college basketball for 14 years, and spent one year with the then New Jersey Nets in their analytics department. According to Bloom, some of the most important stats when evaluating player performance are shooting percentages and what a player does to impact winning. One of the best statistics to measure impact on winning is win shares. </p>

   <p>The league average in field goal percentage typically hovers anywhere from 44% to 46%. Using this parameter, we can see which second rounders met or exceeded that average in their careers. The graphic to the right shows the players who have met or eclipsed this number in their careers while averaging ten or more minutes per game.</p><P>There are 124 players that met the requirements set from the graphic. This means that out of the 540 drafted since 2004, roughly just 24% of them have a league average field goal percentage. This is with players who played center included, who are expected to have field goal percentages around at least 50%, due to the fact that the majority of their shots come close to the basket. There are 33 centers or forwards/centers in the graphic. Without them included, only 17% of second round picks have met the league average field goal percentage.

    <p>As Bloom said, another good thing to look for to see if a player has been successful is their impact on winning. An advanced stat like <a href= "https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/ws.html">win shares</a> looks to find just that - How many wins a player added to their team measured through offense, defense, and playing time. </p><p>As can be seen in the chart below, 197 second round draft picks since 2004 have accrued one or more win shares in their career. The graph is organzied by the year the player was drafted, so it is easier to see when they began to accrue win shares. This graph does not include players with less than one, of which there were 106. 237 players had 0 wins shares or had a negative amount. This means that nearly 64% of second round draft selections failed to gain even one win share in their entire career, or careers to date. Just 8% (48 players) have over 20 wins shares. Though it is important to note that there are active players still adding to their totals. </p>

Finally, letâ€™s look at the teams that have drafted these players. From there we can see which teams have been the most successful drafting in the second round.

    <p>Shown in the chart, some teams have drafted players who have accumulated nearly 200 win shares while others have not come close to triple digits. Then you have the true outlier in the Memphis Grizzlies, who have drafted 11 players in the second round since 2004. Those players have combined for less than 15 win shares. Detroit, who has drafted the most win shares, have drafted 24 players in the same time span. Despite the difference in the number of players drafted and the disparity in win shares, it is clear that Memphis has simply not drafted as well as Detroit. Even one solid draft choice by Memphis would be enough to close the gap between them and the next lowest team, the Nets, where they would no longer be such a big outlier. Only a handful of teams have managed to either find consistent value in second round picks, or hit on a superstar player, like Nikola Jokic. </p>

    <p> There are so many different ways to evaluate player success. Some use data and analytics, while others simply rely on the eye test to form their opinions. This is not the perfect analysis by any means, but it is clear that second round draft picks rarely yield successful results for NBA teams.
